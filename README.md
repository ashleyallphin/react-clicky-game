This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Overview

Clicky Game is a React-based memory challenge app.

## Game Instructions
A dozen Mighty Boosh characters are rendered to the page.  Click on each character without repeating until all twelve characters have been selected to win the game.  If a character is clicked twice, the game will restart.

## Functionality

#### Character Card props are rendered to the page.  Each click is recorded and shuffles the positions of the cards.

#### Selecting a new character increments the user's score by 1.

#### Clicking on a previously selected character twice resets the user's score to 0.
